🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you unleash the beast, make sure your system is ready:

Python 3.8+: The engine powering this monster. 🐍
Dependencies: Install required Python packages with one command:pip install rich


useragent.txt: Generate a list of user-agents using useragentgenerator.py (details below). 📜
Network Access: Ensure you have a stable connection to hit your target. 🌐
Linux/Windows/macOS: Works on any platform with Python installed. 💻


⚙️ Installation
Follow these steps to get KENSPLOIT up and running:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/kensploit.git
cd kensploit


Install Dependencies:
pip install rich


Generate User-Agents:Run useragentgenerator.py to create a useragent.txt file with randomized user-agents:
python useragentgenerator.py


Enter the number of user-agents (e.g., 1000 for testing, max 100,000,000).
Specify the output file (e.g., useragent.txt).
Example:🔥 Jumlah User-Agent (max 100.000.000): 1000
📁 Nama file output (contoh: useragent.txt): useragent.txt
✅ 1000 UserAgent saved to useragent.txt 🔥




Verify Files:Ensure start.py, useragentgenerator.py, and useragent.txt are in the same directory.



🚀 Usage
Time to unleash the chaos! Follow these steps to launch an attack:

Run the Tool:
python start.py


Enter Attack Parameters:

Target IP: The IP address of the target (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Port: The port to hit (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
Threads: Number of threads for the attack (e.g., 100 for a solid blast).
Duration: Attack duration in seconds (e.g., 60 for a minute-long assault).Example input:

🌐 Target IP: 192.168.1.1
📡 Port: 80
⚙️ Jumlah Thread: 100
⏱️ Durasi (detik): 60


Watch the Magic:

The tool will display a live dashboard with:
Real-Time Stats: RPS, Mbps, total requests, and data sent.
Attack Details: Target IP, port, threads, duration, and start time.
Progress Bar: Visualizes thread activity.


Example output:🚀 GASKEUN KE 192.168.1.1:80 Pake 100 Thread Selama 60 Detik!! 💥




Stop the Attack:

Press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z to stop the attack gracefully.
The tool will display a confirmation: 🛑 SERANGAN DIHENTIKAN MANUAL ‼️.




🧠 How It Works

start.py:

Creates a multi-threaded HTTP flooder that sends randomized HTTP requests (GET, POST, HEAD, PUT).
Uses socket for low-level TCP connections to the target IP and port.
Pulls user-agents from useragent.txt to mask requests.
Tracks performance with rich library for a sleek, real-time dashboard.
Handles graceful shutdown with signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTSTP).


useragentgenerator.py:

Generates realistic user-agents for various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS).
Supports up to 100M user-agents for maximum stealth.
Saves output to a file (e.g., useragent.txt) for use in start.py.




💻 Example Attack
python start.py

Input:
🌐 Target IP: 192.168.1.1
📡 Port: 80
⚙️ Jumlah Thread: 500
⏱️ Durasi (detik): 120

Output:
🚀 GASKEUN KE 192.168.1.1:80 Pake 500 Thread Selama 120 Detik!! 💥

The tool will flood the target with HTTP requests, showing live stats like:

RPS: Requests per second.
Mbps: Data sent per second.
Total Requests: Cumulative requests.
Total Data Sent: Data in megabytes.


🔧 Customization

Increase Threads: Crank up the thread count for more power (e.g., 1000 threads). Be cautious of system limits! 💪
Extend Duration: Set longer durations for sustained attacks (e.g., 3600 for an hour).
User-Agent Variety: Generate more user-agents with useragentgenerator.py for better stealth.
Modify Payloads: Edit generate_payload in start.py to add custom headers or methods.


🐛 Troubleshooting

"useragent.txt not found":
Run useragentgenerator.py to create the file.
Ensure useragent.txt is in the same directory as start.py.


Connection Errors:
Check if the target IP and port are reachable.
Reduce thread count if your system or network is overloaded.


High CPU/Memory Usage:
Lower the thread count or duration.
Run on a more powerful machine for max performance! 💻


Dependencies Missing:
Install rich with pip install rich.
